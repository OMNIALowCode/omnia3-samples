## Contributing and Feedback

If you're planning on contributing to this repository there are two things you need to read first: 

1. Thank you for being awesome ✌ 
2. Please read the following guidelines so that you have all the necessary information to correctly perform pull requests.

### Contribute guidelines
**Important**: Before you start developing something (anything), please submit an [issue](../issues) first so that our team can evaluate if your contribution makes sense within that context (we can already be working on something similar to your contribution, for example). 

To submit your contribution you’ll need to use Git (if you’ve never used it before, please follow [this helpful link](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)) or directly use [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Now, please, follow the next steps:

- To make changes without affecting the original project please *[fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)* a copy of the current repository. This clones the *master branch* (the current main code) to a new *branch* for you to work on;
- Make any change, correction or implementation you intend;
- *Commit* (with a clear, simple and direct message resuming your contribution) and *push* your changes to the new *forked branch* you’ve created. You can *push* multiple commits to the same *branch* to distinguish modifications; 
- Open a new *[pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)* with a clear message summing up every *commit* you’ve made. Basically, this creates a request for our development team review your code modifications and, if accepted, *merge* it into the *master branch*; 
- Your *Pull Request* will be *merged* once you have the sign-off of our development team.
