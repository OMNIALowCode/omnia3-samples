## Web Components
### Using storybook
We are using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/) to create a gallery of ready-to-use Web Components.

**If you want to develop your own Web Component** using this environment, you should:
* Clone or download the [repository](https://github.com/OMNIALowCode/omnia3-samples);
* Install the packages (inside the _webcomponents_ folder, run the command _npm install_);
* Open the _webcomponents_ folder in your code editor;
* Inside the _web-components_ folder you have all the available Web Components;
* To try it in your local machine, run the command _npm run storybook_.

**If you want to add and test a new Web Component**, you should:
* Add a new folder to the _web-components_ folder;
* Inside the Web Components's folder you must have three files:
    * *.js: Contains the Web Component code;
    * *.stories.js: Contains the Storybook's [stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-html/#step-4-write-your-stories);
    * readme.md: The Web Component's documentation.
